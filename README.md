# AR-808
AR-808 (named after Roland's iconic TR-808 Rhythm Composer) is the project of building a fully fledged drum machine with a 16-step step sequencer with arduino.

The current design uses sampled sounds and runs on two Arduino Uno R3 boards, one serving as a clock and another one in charge of the sampling.
